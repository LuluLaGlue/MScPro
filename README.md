# Epitech MSc Pro Projetcs
This repository contains the main projects of Epitech's MSc Pro with an Artificial Intelligence Major and a Big Data Minor.

## Organization
Each project has its own folder:
  - ### Year 1:
    * #### **Semester 1**:
      - _***T-POO-700***_: Phoenix pool with a final objective to create a VueJS web app and a Phoenix API.
      - _***T-WEB-700***_: ReactJS web platform following cryptocurrencies based on several RSS fluxes connected to a NodeJS API.
      - _***T-NSA-700***_: Setup several virtual machines in order to create a shared hosting plateform to automate the deployment of several applications.
    * #### **Semester 2**:
      - _***T-DEV-810***_: Build an AI capable of detecting pneumonia based on X-Ray scans.
      - _***T-WEB-800***_: Create a trip planner which gathers intel based on external APIs and suggests events and services.
  - ### Year 2:
    * #### **Semester 1**:
      - _***T-AIA-901***_: Based on a vocal query ("I want to go from Paris to Lyon"), create an AI capable of returning possible train travels.
      - _***T-DAT-901***_: Based on user's purchase data create a recommender to offer a gift to each client based on their preferences.
    * #### **Semester 2**:
      - _***T-AIA-902***_: A program able to solve a game, with an optimized model-free episodic learning algorithm. The agent is a taxi that must pick up a passenger present in a random location on the map, and drop them off in one of four possible locations. 
      - _***T-IOT-902***_: Deploy several environmental sensors within a radius of a few kilometers around a single WiFi access point. Use an API to share your data with many others users and use all data available to build awesome monitoring dashboards.
